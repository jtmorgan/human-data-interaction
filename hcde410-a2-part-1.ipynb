    "**All datasets have limitations. Any of these limitations can be a potential source of bias.** In the context of data, a \"bias\" is really just a divergence between what a dataset is supposed to capture about the world--according to the *dataset designer's intention*, or according to the *end-user's expectations*--and what's actually represented in the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "So biases in data are often highly *contextual*, which can make them subtle and hard to spot. Similarly, it's hard to predict ahead of time what the *consequences* of those biases might be, because it depends on what the data is being used for."

    "- **misleading data:** it looks like a piece of data means one thing, but it actually means something different\n",

    "The nature or scale of these consequences can be hard to predict. That's why any time you prepare to use data that you didn't gather yourself, it pays to spend some time exploring the dataset, identifying limitations, and thinking critically about how these limitations might affect your analysis or your machine learning model."
